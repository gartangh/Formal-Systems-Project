Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated.
Progress(16) at 2018-05-23 16:29:01: 185456 states generated (185,456 s/min), 66203 distinct states found (66,203 ds/min), 23074 states left on queue.
Progress(30) at 2018-05-23 16:30:01: 5609815 states generated (5,424,359 s/min), 1438375 distinct states found (1,372,172 ds/min), 90677 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 5.4E-7
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 4.3E-7
7372489 states generated, 1798684 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 47.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 8 and the 95th percentile is 4).
