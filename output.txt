The depth of the complete state graph search is 31.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 14 and the 95th percentile is 4).
Error: Java ran out of memory.  Running Java with a larger memory allocation
pool (heap) may fix this.  But it won't help if some state has an enormous
number of successor states, or if TLC must compute the value of a huge set.
