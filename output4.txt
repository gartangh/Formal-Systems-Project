Progress(17) at 2018-05-23 16:11:59: 191509 states generated (191,509 s/min), 65802 distinct states found (65,802 ds/min), 20324 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.2E-7
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.3E-7
3452541 states generated, 856107 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 41.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 7 and the 95th percentile is 3).
